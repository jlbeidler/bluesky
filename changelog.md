***Note that this release is not backwards compatible with regards to the output data structure, specifically the 'visualization' section of the output. (Since visualization now supports multiple targets, the hysplit dispersion info is now under "visualization" > "dispersion" > "hysplit" instead of "visualization" > "hysplit"). As with v4.1, we decided to keep the major version 4.***
