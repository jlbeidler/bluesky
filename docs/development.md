# Development

First, clone the repo and build the docker image,
as described in the [installation](installation.md).  (If opting
to develop without docker, see also the
[dependencies](dependencies.md) docs.  The instrucitons on this
page, however, assume that you use docker.)

## PYTHONPATH

This project contains a single package, ```bluesky```. To import bluesky
in development, you'll have to add the repo root directory to the
search path. The ```bsp``` script does this automatically, so it's only
necessary for importing bluesky elsewhere.


## Interactive python session

The following starts an ipython session with docker with your local
copy of the code mounted in the docker container and added
to the beggining of PATH and PYTHONPATH env vars.

    docker run --rm -ti --user bluesky \
        -v $HOME/code/pnwairfire-bluesky/:/bluesky/ \
        -e PYTHONPATH=/bluesky/ \
        -e PATH=/bluesky/bin/:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin \
        bluesky ipython



## Running tests

The following uses py.test to run unit and regression tests
within docker with your local
copy of the code mounted in the docker container and added
to the beggining of PATH and PYTHONPATH env vars.

    docker run --rm -ti --user bluesky \
        -v $HOME/code/pnwairfire-bluesky/:/bluesky/ \
        -e PYTHONPATH=/bluesky/ \
        -e PATH=/bluesky/bin/:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin \
        bluesky py.test --disable-pytest-warnings

You can also use the ```--collect-only``` option to see a list of all tests.

    py.test --collect-only

See [pytest](http://pytest.org/latest/getting-started.html#getstarted) for more information about using pytest.


## Testing export emails

For testing export emails, you can use something like the
[mailtrip](https://pypi.org/project/mailtrap/) package, which has
an smtp server that you cah use to catch and thus test export emails.


## Publishing new version

    ./dev/scripts/bump-version
    git push && git push --tags


## Profiling

To see how much time is being spent in each function call, you can
profile a run by using `bsp`'s `--profile-output-file` option.

    docker run --rm -ti --user bluesky \
        -v $HOME/code/pnwairfire-bluesky/:/bluesky/ \
        -e PYTHONPATH=/bluesky/ \
        -e PATH=/bluesky/bin/:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin \
        bluesky bsp --profile-output-file ...
